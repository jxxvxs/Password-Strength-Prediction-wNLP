# Password-Strength-Prediction-wNLP
#### A Beginner's Attempt on Data Science using Natural Language Processing based on :


* ### [*Kaggle* - Password Strength Classifier Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bhavikbb/password-strength-classifier-dataset)
* ### [Udemy course - Data Science Real World Projects ](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-real-world-projects-in-python-x/)


#### This repo contains a ***dataset*** that measures password strength by 3 category, with a tool called ***PARS*** by Georgia Tech university. This is created for learning purposes, trying to build a model that predict the category of Password whether it is Strong, Good or Weak.
## Note :
#### The custom dataset was created by me for learning purposes, it contains more than ***3 million rows***. It is a list of alleged gmail passwords that was taken from public repositories on github, you can visit it [***here***](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/alleged-gmail-passwords.txt)
